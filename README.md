# Extractive text summarization comparison

In this we compare a few Python libaries for Extractive text summarization.  In Extractive text summarization, the algorithm selects the most representative sentences from the paragraph that can effectively summarize it.  Unlike Abstractive summarization, it does not paraphrase the text.  

We compare the following Python packages:
  
1 Sumy
  * Luhn's algorithm
  * LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis)
  * TextRank
  * LexRank
  * SumBasic
  * KL Distance
2 Gensim
3 PyTeaser
4 PyTextRank
